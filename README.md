# FitsShow_python


The code (0433_2021.py) will show a fits file and make two zoomed-in parts.  It plots all of them in one figure.  

Other codes calculate the physical parameters of lens objects due to three microlensing events based on observing parameters (including the lens  brightnes, the event time scale, the source distance).  

The SDMLs_mindstep.cpp generates short-duration microlensing evenets (SDMLs) that are detectable by the OGLE group.  These microlensing events have tE<12 days. Their lens objects can be planets, brown dwarfs, and main-sequence stars. This code reveals that the fractuion of these populations in generating SDML events. The code use VBBinaryLensing.h to make extended-source microlensing events.  

After making these microlensing events, the distribution of their tEs due to each population can be plotted with SDMLplot_final.py
