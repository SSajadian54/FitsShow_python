# FitsShow_python


The code (0433_2021.py) will show a fits file and make two zoomed-in parts.  It plots all of them in one figure.  

Other codes calculate the physical parameters of lens objects due to three microlensing events based on observing parameters (including the lens  brightnes, the event time scale, the source distance).
